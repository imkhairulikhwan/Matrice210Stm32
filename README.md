# Matrice210Stm32
This code communicates in UART with a [Raspberry Pi Zero](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-zero-w/) and send ADC values.

## Prerequisites

Code developped on [System Workbench for STM32](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/sw4stm32.html) on a [STM32F429IDISCOVERY board](https://www.st.com/en/evaluation-tools/32f429idiscovery.html). Code has been generated with [STM32CubeMX](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stm32cubemx.html). 

## Usage
For full compatibility, use this code with the [Matrice210Pi](https://github.com/jonathanmichel/Matrice210Pi) code on an Raspberry connected to aircraft and the [Matrice210AndroidApp](https://github.com/jonathanmichel/Matrice210Android) on an Android device connected to aircraft remote controller.
